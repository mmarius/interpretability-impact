Abstract#==#This work presents state of the art results in
reconstruction of surface realizations from
obfuscated text. We identify the lack of
sufficient training data as the major obstacle
to training high-performing models,
and solve this issue by generating
large amounts of synthetic training data.
We also propose preprocessing techniques
which make the structure contained in the
input features more accessible to sequence
models. Our models were ranked first
on all evaluation metrics in the English
portion of the 2018 Surface Realization
shared task.

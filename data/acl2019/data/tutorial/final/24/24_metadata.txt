Abstract#==#The primary goals of this tutorial are to review the framework of cross-lingual
EL and motivate it as a broad paradigm for the Information Extraction task. We
will start by discussing the traditional EL techniques and metrics and address
questions relevant to the adequacy of these to across domains and languages. We
will then present more recent approaches such as Neural EL, discuss the basic
building blocks of a state-of-the-art neural EL system and analyze some of the
current results on English EL. We will then proceed to Cross-lingual EL and
discuss methods that work across languages. In particular, we will discuss and
compare multiple methods that make use of multi-lingual word embeddings. We
will also present EL methods that work for both name tagging and linking in
very low resource languages. Finally, we will discuss the uses of cross-lingual
EL in a variety of applications like search engines and commercial product
selling applications. Also, contrary to the 2014 EL tutorial, we will  also 
focus on Entity Discovery which is an essential component of EL.

Abstract#==#Semantic parsers translate natural language utterances        into 
machine-executable  logical  forms  or programs,  and  are  thus  key 
components  in        natural language  understanding  systems.   Semantic parsing 
is  a  well-established  research area, with application  in  areas  such  as 
question  answering, instruction  following, voice assistants, and code
generation.  In the last two years, the models used for semantic  parsing have
changed  dramatically,with the introduction of neural methods that allow us to
rethink many of the previous assumptions underlying semantic parsing.

Traditionally,        the  executable  formalisms  and models  used  in  semantic 
parsing  research  have been heavily reliant on notions of formal semantics in
linguistics, such as Î»-calculus generated by a CCG parser.  However, recent
work with neural encoder-decoder semantic parsers allow for more accessible
formalisms, such as standard programming  languages,  and  NMT-style  models 
that  are much        more  approachable  to        a  broader  NLP  audience.   We will
present an overview of modern neural methods for semantic parsing and how they
have changed semantic parsing research.

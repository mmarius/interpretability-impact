Abstract#==#Developing an intelligent dialogue system that not only emulates human
conversation, but also can answer questions of topics ranging from latest news
of a movie star to Einstein's theory of relativity, and fulfill complex tasks
such as travel planning, has been one of the longest running goals in AI. The
goal remains elusive until recently when we started observing promising results
in both the research community and industry as the large amount of conversation
data is available for training and the breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) and
reinforcement learning (RL) are applied to conversational AI.  

In this tutorial, we start with a brief introduction to the recent progress on
DL and RL that is related to natural language processing and conversational AI.
Then, we describe in detail the state-of-the-art neural approaches developed
for three types of dialogue systems. The first is a question answering (QA)
agent. Equipped with rich knowledge drawn from various data sources including
Web documents and pre-complied knowledge graphs (KG's), the QA agent can
provide concise direct answers to user queries.  The second is a
task-oriented dialogue system that can help users accomplish tasks ranging
from meeting scheduling to vacation planning. The third is a social chat bot
which can converse seamlessly and appropriately with humans, and often plays
roles of a chat companion and a recommender. In the final part of the tutorial,
we review attempts to developing open-domain conversational AI systems that
combine the strengths of different types of dialogue systems.

Abstract#==#Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (including generation, language
grounding, reasoning, information extraction, coreference resolution, and
dialog) can be formulated as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) problems.
However, since language is often discrete and the space for all sentences is
infinite, there are many challenges for formulating reinforcement learning
problems of NLP tasks. In this tutorial, we provide a gentle introduction to
the foundation of deep reinforcement learning, as well as some practical DRL
solutions in NLP. We describe recent advances in designing deep reinforcement
learning for NLP, with a special focus on generation, dialogue, and information
extraction. Finally, we discuss why they succeed, and when they may fail,
aiming at providing some practical advice about deep reinforcement learning for
solving real-world NLP problems.

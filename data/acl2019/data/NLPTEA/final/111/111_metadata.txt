Abstract#==#This paper investigates what differentiates effective tutorial sessions from less effective sessions. Towards this end, we characterize and explore human tutors' actions in tutorial dialogue sessions by mapping the tutor-tutee interactions, which are streams of dialogue utterances, into streams of actions, based on the language-as-action theory. Next, we use human expert judgment measures, evidence of learning (EL) and evidence of soundness (ES), to identify effective and ineffective sessions. We perform sub-sequence pattern mining to identify sub-sequences of dialogue modes that discriminate good sessions from bad sessions. We finally use the results of sub-sequence analysis method to generate a tutorial Markov process for effective tutorial sessions.

Abstract#==#The open-source SUMMA Platform is a highly scalable distributed
architecture for monitoring a large number of media broadcasts in
parallel, with a lag behind actual broadcast time of at most a few
minutes.

It assembles numerous state-of-the-art NLP technologies into a fully
automated media ingestion pipeline that can record live broadcasts,
detect and transcribe spoken content, translate from several languages
(original text or transcribed speech) into English, 
recognize Named Entities, detect
topics, cluster and summarize documents across language barriers, and
extract and store factual claims in these news items.

This paper describes the intended use cases and discusses the system
design decisions that allowed us to integrate state-of-the-art NLP
modules into an effective workflow with comparatively little effort.

Abstract#==#UKB is an open source collection of
programs for performing, among other
tasks, Knowledge-Based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Since it was released
in 2009 it has been often used out-of-the-box in sub-optimal settings. We show that
nine years later it is the state-of-the-art on
knowledge-based WSD. This case shows
the pitfalls of releasing open source NLP
software without optimal default settings
and precise instructions for reproducibility.

Abstract#==#This paper describes the test of a dependency parsing method which is based on bidirectional LSTM feature representations and multilingual word embedding, and evaluates the results on mono- and multilingual data. The results are similar in all cases, with a slightly better result achieved using multilingual data. The languages under investigation are Komi-Zyrian and Russian. Examination of the results by relation type shows that some language specific constructions are correctly recognized even when they appear in naturally occurring code-switching data.

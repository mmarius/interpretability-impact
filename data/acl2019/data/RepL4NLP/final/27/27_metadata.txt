Abstract#==#Learning vector space representation of words (i.e., word embeddings) has recently attracted wide research interests, and has been extended to cross-lingual scenario. 
Currently most cross-lingual word embedding learning models are based on sentence alignment, which inevitably introduces much noise. 
In this paper, we show in Chinese and Japanese, the acquisition of semantic relation among words can benefit from the large number of common characters shared by both languages; 
inspired by this unique feature, we design a method named CJC  targeting to generate cross-lingual context of words.
We combine CJC with GloVe based on matrix factorization, and then propose an integrated model named CJ-Glo. 
Taking two sentence-aligned models and CJ-BOC (also exploits common characters but is based on CBOW) as baseline algorithms, we compare them with CJ-Glo on a series of NLP tasks including cross-lingual synonym, word analogy and sentence alignment. 
The result indicates CJ-Glo achieves the best performance among these methods, and is more stable in cross-lingual tasks; moreover, compared with CJ-BOC, CJ-Glo is less sensitive to the alteration of parameters.

Abstract#==#This paper presents a dataset and supervised classification approach for economic event detection in English news articles.
Currently, the economic domain is lacking resources and methods for data-driven supervised event detection.
The detection task is conceived as a sentence-level classification task for 10 different economic event types.
Two different machine learning approaches were tested: a rich feature set Support Vector Machine (SVM) set-up and a word-vector-based long short-term memory recurrent neural network (RNN-LSTM) set-up.
We show satisfactory results for most event types, with the linear kernel SVM outperforming the other experimental set-ups

Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a new unsuper-
vised learning framework to use news events
for predicting trends in stock prices. We
present Word Influencer Networks (WIN), a
graph framework to extract longitudinal tem-
poral relationships between any pair of infor-
mative words from news streams. Using the
temporal occurrence of words, WIN measures
how the appearance of one word in a news
stream influences the emergence of another set
of words in the future. The latent word-word
influencer relationships in WIN are the build-
ing blocks for causal reasoning and predic-
tive modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of
WIN by using it for unsupervised extraction of
latent features for stock price prediction and
obtain 2 orders lower prediction error com-
pared to a similar causal graph based method.
WIN discovered influencer links from seem-
ingly unrelated words from topics like poli-
tics to finance. WIN also validated 67% of
the causal evidence found manually in the text
through a direct edge and the rest 33% through
a path of length 2.

Abstract#==#We report the results of our experiments
in the context of the NEWS 2018 Shared
Task on Transliteration. We focus on the
comparison of several diverse systems, including
three neural MT models. A combination
of discriminative, generative, and
neural models obtains the best results on
the development sets. We also put forward
ideas for improving the shared task.

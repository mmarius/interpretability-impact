Abstract#==#Transliterating named entities from one language into another can be approached as neural machine translation (NMT) problem, for which we use deep attentional RNN encoder-decoder models.  To build a strong transliteration system, we apply well-established techniques from NMT, such as dropout regularization, model ensembling, rescoring with right-to-left models, and back-translation.  Our submission to the NEWS 2018 Shared Task on Named Entity Transliteration ranked first in several tracks.

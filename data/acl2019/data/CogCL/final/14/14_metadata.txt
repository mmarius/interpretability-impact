Abstract#==#This paper presents a statistical model to
predict Japanese word order in the double
object constructions. We employed a
Bayesian linear mixed model with manually
annotated predicate-argument structure
data. The findings from the refined
corpus analysis confirmed the effects of
information status of an NP as ‘givennew
ordering’ in addition to the effects of
‘long-before-short’ as a tendency of the
general Japanese word order.
